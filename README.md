# Deep-Learning-Based-Stroke-Lesion-Segmentation-with-Explainability-Analysis
This project presents an automated pipeline for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) scans using 3D deep learning. The system incorporates explainability analysis through perturbation methods to provide interpretable predictions for clinical decision-making.
